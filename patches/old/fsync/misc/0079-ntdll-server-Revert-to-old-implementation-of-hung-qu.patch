Subject: [PATCH 79/83] ntdll, server: Revert to old implementation of hung
 queue detection.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

By manually notifying the server every time we enter and exit a message wait.

The hung queue logic keeps breaking. In the case of bug #9 it was breaking
because we were waiting for more than 5 seconds on our queue and then someone
sent us a message with SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG. Just stop fighting against the
server and try to co√∂perate with it instead. It takes two extra server calls,
but ideally the GUI thread isn't going to be in the same sort of performance-
critical code that this patchset was written for.
